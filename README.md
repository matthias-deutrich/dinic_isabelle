This repository hosts the code developed as part of the master thesis "Formalising Dinicâ€™s Algorithm in
Isabelle/HOL" by Matthias Deutrich at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). While the aforementioned
thesis is finished, the code in this repository is still a work in progress, in the hopes of one day
making it into the Isabelle AFP.
